            <p><i>Hello! My name is Brenan, but you can call me Lester or Enan. My favorite character ever since i was a kid is Son Goku. 
                There is really no particular reason why i like him, the only reason why i like him because he become stronger that his current self when there is predicament.
                I will provide a photo for a reference so that you can also see how he look. 
                Next lets talk about my friends while i was still studying on college. 
                I will provide a table that shows there name, section, and age at that time.
            </i></p>
            <p><i>I currently resides at purok 3, Sampaloc, Apalit Pampanga, But i was born on Tacloban City. 
                I am currently studying at La Verdad Christian College, and i am taking up Associate in Computer Technology.
                You might be thinking why ACT. Let me tell you why, i don't really know anything about computer programming or computer in general.
                I was supposed to take Civil Engineering or Accountancy, but sadly i cannot pursue either of the two since i am not a ABM student and Engineering isn't available.
            </i></p>
            <p><i>So here I am, trying to learn more about computers and programming. I hope to improve my skills and knowledge in this field.
                I am excited to see where this journey takes me!. Hope you can join me in this adventure!
